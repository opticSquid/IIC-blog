    Body: "Agriculture in India accounts for 17% of the country’s GDP and provides employment to 40%  of the workforce. Yet this sector continues to face problems like an inefficient way of farming,  traditional mindset, overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, etc. BharatAgri is one of the very scarce start-ups that focuses on solving the problems faced by the agricultural sector by the use of cutting-edge technology. The founder of  BharatAgri Sai Gole and Siddhart Dialami hopes to revolutionize the way Indian farmers grow and sell their produce. <br /> <br /> BharatAgri is one of the most innovative start-ups in our country. It provides farmers with smart farming practices and suggestions based on varying conditions and promises to increase their yield. While growing any crop the start-up’s algorithm takes into account more than 30 variables that affect the growth of the crop and provide personalized services. They provide many personalized farming solutions like farm mapping,  water test, fungal test, soil test. This helps them to know the crop which is best suited for that farm and the way to grow the crop. This is extremely profitable for the farmers who before did not have access to this cutting-edge technology. The app developed by them creates a  “dynamic calendar” that tells farmers which and how much seed and fertilizers to use, the quantity of water apply and at what times based on changing climatic conditions. The amount of money spent by the farmers per acre decreases and the amount of profit earned by them increases. They have fewer instances of pests and diseases and the quality of products is also high. <br /> <br />  BharatAgri’s founders were also aware of the technological barriers between them and farmers.  They use SMS and Interactive Voice Responses  (IVR) calls. The mobile application developed by  them is user-friendly and compatible with farmers  who are new to this platform. They also use video service/one on one chat to connect with famers. <br /><br />  BharatAgri is an innovative start-up that aims to  solve the major problems faced by the 140 million  farmers of this country. Besides, there are many industries like banks, farm-to-market companies,  seed manufacturers, etc. who are directly trying to do business with farmers but are limited by the acute shortage of data. BharatAgri connects industries to verifies farmers and reduce inefficiencies. <br /><br />  The start-up is still in its infant years but has a  strong potential. It can help in improving productivity and the value chain of agriculture in  India. Famers who have used their service have  already seen a tenfold increase in their profit. ",

      Nowadays air pollution becomes a major reason behind several diseases. Air pollution accounts for an estimated 4.2 million deaths per year. It can also cause long term damage to people’s nerves, brains, kidneys, liver and other organs. <br />
      But let’s think about what happens when we create an opportunity from air pollution. An opportunity that brings a positive impact to our earth and thus our life. Air-ink is an ink that is obtained directly from air pollution. It is invented by Anirudh Sharma an MIT graduate. <br /><br />
      <strong>The source of the idea - </strong> <br />
      One day Anirudh Sharma captured a photo of a diesel generator blowing black soot against a white wall. The dark triangular strain made him think seriously about pollution and also about pigment-like ink. <br />
      To capture air pollution Anirudh and his team members created a device that could capture air pollution at the source in engines or factory machinery, this filtering device is called “kaalink" which is derived from the Hindi word (black ). It is a device comprised of a steel cylinder that is fixed to an exhaust pipe. <br />
      Generally, inks are made up of soot(obtained from fossil fuels) but Air- ink is the first commercial ink made entirely from air pollution. <br /><br />
      <strong> Uses of inks - </strong> <br />
      Inks are extremely useful as it is used in books, newspapers, pens, tattoos, imperative for artist and many more. Thus, from all this, we can conclude that inks are a very powerful medium to connect with people.<br /><br />

      <strong>Advantages of air ink over normal inks - </strong> <br />
      Normal inks are obtained from fossil fuels which produce a lot of pollutants and causing air pollution <br />
      Air ink can be a priority due to several aspects:<br />
      -The most important aspect is it reduces air pollution<br />
      -It recycles carbon for printing <br />
      -It is long-lasting than normal inks <br />
      -It is high in quality compared to other inks<br />
      -It is deeply pigmented due to which it shows bold writing <br />
      -The word spread more fast compared to normal inks <br /><br />

      <strong>Conclusion </strong> <br />
      -It is the best way for controlling air pollution in the environment and best for living things to protect the health <br />
      -It is very useful for the life cycle to protect us from various airborne diseases <br />
      -Air ink is currently available as 2mm, 15mm, 30mm, and 50mm markers and a 150ml screen printing ink set <br />
      -Many artists are using it without any issues they use air ink in wall painting, painting, and many other things. <br /><br />

      I feel very fascinated by this innovation as it enhances our science and technology field in a very constructive manner. Now, its time for us to think about such ideas and takes a major step towards the science and technology field in an environmentally friendly manner

    We have always heard that the tech companies like Facebook, Xiaomi, etc have been stealing and collecting our data to store it in their servers. We have also heard that sometimes sensitive user data are leaked on the internet to anonymous people, popularly termed as “data breach”. For example,  people use VPNs so that they can hide their real IP address and also their internet activity from their  ISP. One of the biggest VPN providers is Nord VPN. In 2018, Nord VPN had a data breach in Florida resulting in the leaking of terabytes of data in a month. My device stops any company from collecting the data that the user has not agreed to share and indirectly also stops people’s data from getting leaked during data breaches. This also has the potential to stop website tracking and online fingerprinting. <br /><br />
    <strong>For Broadband Connection: - </strong> <br />
    My device would be connected in between the router and the fiber/DSL cable coming from the internet service provider (ISP) modem. After a successful setup, the user would be able to blacklist the sites he/she wanted to. There would be my website with several graphs that would show which sites and IPs collect the most data and the history of data leaks and breaches of different apps and websites that are visited the most. The way the device would work is it would first read the packet requested from the server to the host and if the website falls into the users' blacklist, it would first check if the data is being sent to a  server just for verification purpose or for data collection purpose(most data logging occurs in specific global IP ranges, so it(the device) would check if the IP of the host falls into the list
    of IPs that collect data). If it finds that there is more than a 50% chance that the user’s data is likely to be sent to an IP that collects data, then it would randomize the data first. It would also warn the user and ask the user if he/she wants to proceed with sending the information. <br /><br />
    <strong>For PHONES with SIM Internet:- </strong> <br />
    A physical device is not possible to be connected to a mobile phone 24/7. It would make the device clumsy and heavy. So I have come up with a software solution for mobiles. Mobile users will download an app that would work as a VPN but the only fact would be that it would direct all the traffic coming into and going out from the mobile device into that app itself. The app will do the same process that I  had mentioned in the device for the broadband connection. The software will also have a region for blacklisting whitelisting specific sites and apps. This app could help with the fact that most Chinese phones have some sort of data collection software embedded that cannot be uninstalled.  <br /><br />

    Body: `A Device that uses a different kind of light to empower those without access to what many people take for granted: Internet Connectivity. <br /><br />
    The Internet can also be accessed through standard wireless technology that has existed for over 100 years and was first used for radios. This technology has saturated in terms of its speed capacity. The technology has reached to an extent on what proportion of speeds it can support.  <br /><br />
    Therefore, the world is slowly moving forward to fiber optic cables to cater to the demand for high-speed connections. However, fiber optic cables are expensive to deploy, as they need to be installed underground, while digging hundreds of kilometres to lay down cables to provide Internet are often costly, the cost of setting up cell towers is no less. There’s a lot of areas in the world that don’t 
    have proper access to the internet because establishing infrastructure in those spaces is too expensive and inconvenient. Every individual, regardless of where they reside, should have access to the internet.  <br /><br />
    That’s where a Singapore-based Start-up Company Transcelestial comes in to fix the current issues and help accelerate global internet distribution the Global Internet Distribution Problem. Their CENTAURI One is a laser communication device that will help people get access to superfast internet. Their product uses wireless laser communication technology to establish a distribution network between buildings,
    cell towers, poles, and other physical infrastructure. All you need to do is go on a rooftop or higher grounds, mount the device, point it facing towards the closest location nearby, where you do have access to the internet. You mount another one of these devices on that rooftop as well, the laser system will find itself, and boom!!, you have a fiber-like connection between the two buildings. <br /><br />
    The world has been desperately waiting for the launch of 5G technology that promises previously unimaginable Internet speeds, but 5G is a short-range technology with a range of about 1,000 feet.  There are two versions of the device that are developed– one catered for 4G networks, with a  bandwidth of 1Gbps and another catered for 5G networks, with a bandwidth of 10Gbps both with3- 5km range.CENTAURI weighs 
    less than 3 kg and can deliver true fiber-like speeds to customers. The device is a rapidly deployable, affordable, low-cost, and high-speed Last Mile Connectivity solution that can speed up the adoption of 4G and 5G globally. Trancelestial had a vision of delivering high-speed internet globally via Nano-satellite that could reach record-breaking internet speeds of a few hundred gigabits per second, or hundreds
    of times faster than current consumer broadband internet. This company with an Indian Origin co-founder Rohit Jha has raised US$1.8 million in seed funding. <br />
    Their ultimate goal is to build a global network of satellites using lasers to connect every single place on the planet to each other. Connectivity for everyone. An ambitious plan to bring you blazing fast internet – by shooting lasers from space.

    Human history is told by the energy we use. At first, we used our muscles, then we learned to control fire. We industrialized the world using coal & oil and entered the Atomic age when we learned to crack the atom. At each step, we increased our energy harvest to a scale never seen before and advanced as a species. Currently, we are transitioning to renewables and if we’re lucky, fusion energy will become viable in the future. <br /><br />
    As humanity progresses further, if we don’t destroy ourselves or our habitat, we will likely gain control of our entire planet and its resources. At that stage, we’ll probably look forwards to expansion. But space is hard and establishing a human presence in the solar system will require ungodly amounts of energy. Luckily we know where to find it. The Sun- the ultimate source of energy, a furnace 100 quintillion times more powerful than our 
    most efficient nuclear reactor. It shines with the energy of a trillion nuclear bombs per second. <br /><br />
    If we want to collect the most energy physically possible, we’ll have to build the largest most ambitious structure in the Universe-The Dyson sphere, a megastructure that encompasses a whole star to capture its power output. The first description was given by Olaf Stapeldon, which was later popularized by Freeman Dyson.  <br /><br />
    For an intelligent species, building a Dyson Sphere is a technological leap on a par with the discovery of fire by our ancestors-the transition from planetary species to interstellar species would usher in an age of exploration and expansion we can barely imagine. <br /><br />
    So what would it look like? A solid shell enveloping the Sun is not a good idea. A large rigid body will be prone to impacts, possibly shattering. It would be liable to drift and could crash into the Sun. A more viable design is the Dyson Swarm- an enormous set of orbiting panels that collects the Sun’s power and beam it elsewhere. Such a swarm would give humanity unlimited energy, but building it won’t be easy. The Sun is big and so we need a 
    lot of satellites. If each satellite is a square km, it would take 30 quadrillions to surround the Sun. Also, we’ll need a lot of raw materials to build them, a lot of effort to assemble them and put them into proper positions. <br /><br />
    We also need a permanent infrastructure setup in space to start building. Mercury is the best candidate. It’s closest to the Sun & is metal-rich. Closer to Sun means less moving around materials. Next, we should consider the design. Simple is better. They are most likely going to be enormous mirrors that refocus sunlight and send it to central collecting stations. Lastly, we need the energy and power to launch satellites into space. But don’t 
    worry, there’s plenty of sunlight on Mercury, so let’s get to work.<br /><br />
    There are 4 major pieces of technology required- Solar collectors, miners, refiners, and launch equipment. The Solar collectors will collect the energy, provide them to our miners and refiners to dig and refine the raw materials. The next step is launching the satellites into space. Rockets aren’t preferable since they are too expensive, difficult to deorbit and reuse. Instead, we can use a sort of railgun- a curved Electromagnetic track that 
    launches our satellites to outer space, at high speeds. <br /><br />
    Each panel provides energy to build the other. Just about 60 doubling times, we’ll cover the entire sun. That puts us in completing the project in a decade. Even collecting 1% of the Sun’s energy is an unbelievable change in our species’ energy budget. Many believe that there are such spheres out there in the Milky Way, we just haven’t spotted them. <br /><br />
    It is far from certain that humanity will ever get to this point. Our focus is on short-term political gains and conflicts that won’t matter in the long run. But if we overcome these challenges and live as one planet-one people, the only limitation left will be our imagination. <br /><br />

    “Innovation is taking two things that exist and putting them together in a new way.“-Tom Freston (born 1945), Co-founder of MTV <br /><br />
    Smartwatches are the new technology that is changing today’s world. The most unique feature of it is that it is wearable and the first of its kind. In the coming days, it will be one of the first affordable, wearable smart gadgets. Gradually, it is changing the way we communicate through its unique and fascinating features. It has already grabbed the attention of a large audience. With each passing day, we are getting to see several impacts of new technology and smart devices around us, which are affecting our daily life, one of them being smartwatches. <br /><br />
    While digital watches have been around for decades—some with abilities like calculators and unit converters—only in the 2010s did tech companies begin releasing watches with smartphone-like abilities. Apple, Samsung, Sony, and other major players offer smartwatches on the consumer market, but a small startup company deserves credit for popularizing today’s smartwatches. When Pebble announced its first smartwatch in 2013, it raised a record amount of funding on Kickstarter and went on to sell more than 1 million units. At the same time, advances in silicon 
    miniaturization opened the door to other kinds of dedicated-purpose smartwatches. Companies like Garmin, for example, support smartwatches like the Fenix, which are more rugged and are optimized with sensors and trackers to support back-country expeditions. Likewise, companies like Suunto released smartwatches optimized for scuba diving that withstand extended time at significant depths. <br /><br />
    Smartwatches are one of the first series of smart wearable gadgets. It’s not big or heavy like other devices. Most devices are hand-held or bigger, but with smartwatches, you can wear them on your wrist like a watch or rather, like a fashion accessory. This can free your hands and still carry on a conversation. Smartwatches are going to change the way we communicate. You can make phone calls from your wrist and you can send text messages and talk just like a phone. It functions just like a smartphone with added features. With smartwatches, 
    you can call anyone from your wrist. You can take pictures and save them to your devices from the smartwatch. You can also do video calling all from this little wristwatch. It’s changing the way we can communicate and it cost-effective. Smartwatches are one of the first affordable wearable smart devices. It is small, affordable, and carries most of the same features as your phone. <br /><br />
    Smartwatches are changing the world as we live. Not so much right now but soon, it will certainly be the best thing around.

    Mental illnesses affect 19% of the adult population, 46% of teenagers, and 13% of children each year. People struggling with their mental health may be in our family, living next door, or in our workplaces. However, only half of those affected receive treatment, often because of the stigma attached to mental health. Untreated, mental illness can contribute to higher medical expenses, poorer performance at school and work, fewer employment opportunities, and increased risk of suicide.<br /><br />
    It's very important to remember that just because one may not know exactly what causes someone to experience a mental health problem, this doesn't mean that it is any less serious than any other illness, any less deserving of recognition and treatment, or any easier to recover from. Most potential mental health problems will not become mental health problems if one response to them early. <br /><br />
    Sentio Solutions is a San Francisco based startup that develops digital biomarkers and therapeutics to change the way of diagnosing, monitoring, and caring for mental health. <br /><br /> 
    People suffering from anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorders need continuous monitoring and support tools, to help them manage their own emotions and track all changes in emotional habits or patterns on a daily basis.  <br /><br />
    In today’s busy world, mental health issues are often overlooked. So, a startup like this is a really good initiative in order to create a mentally healthy community.  For people with mental health issues, the social stigma and discrimination they experience can worsen their problems, making it all the more difficult to recover. It may cause the person to feel ashamed, hopeless, isolated, and thus, avoid getting the help they need because of the fear of being stigmatized. <br /><br />
    Here, the emotion-sensing wristband, Feel along with the app comes to the rescue. Feel is a wearable wristband that leverages proprietary algorithms to recognize and track human emotions throughout the day. At the same time, the mobile application provides actionable recommendations based on advanced psychological techniques, to help users develop positive emotional habits and achieve wellbeing. Feel consists of 3 parts: the wristband, the emotion recognition algorithms, and the mobile application. This particular program helps one to develop positive 
    emotional habits through a combination of emotion sensors and evidence-based techniques. It provides dedicated licensed therapists to each individual with depression and anxiety for real-time monitoring and personalized interventions. <br /><br />
    This way the program brings an end to all the inner battles of a person with himself/herself and the society. These inner battles go so unnoticed, yet have such a significant impact on one's life. This program has fascinated me the most because of its simplicity and effectiveness. It gives one the opportunity to overcome any mental obstacles and lead a mentally happy and healthy life.

      What does a startup mean? Literally, it means starting something. Right? Now the question arises, starting something for what? Here comes the idea of <strong>entrepreneurship</strong>. ‘Entrepreneurship’, the word itself is a kind of a mystery to some of us. So, let me start this with a story. That will be more interesting, I guess.<br /><br />
      There’s a story of two friends Ajay and Bhuvan. The time I am talking about was not so popular for sports back then. They both were working for a local factory. But since school days they were interested in sports, especially football. Unfortunately for their family conditions, they couldn’t continue their passion after school. With life, everything changed, and could not step back into their dreams ever. The matches they watched were all flashing upon their memories. Making goals or saving them, penalty-attacks of all legends like Sunil Chhetri, Messi, Ronaldo, Maradona, Pele, and who was not!!<br /><br />
      Though they did what they could. From working in a factory to establishing their own football and other sports goods manufacturing factories. They just didn’t chase their dream but made the paths easy for many of us like them. Sports get popularize also. Moreover, they <strong>gave employment</strong> to lots of youths, and yet their <strong>innovation</strong> of using bio-degradable material for manufacturing helped them with very much <strong>low production cost</strong>. Thus, they could meet their excellence shortly and started exporting <strong>internationally</strong>. Eventually, their small factory became an MNC brand namely <strong>AB</strong>. <br /><br />
      <strong>There’s an essential, intangible something in start-ups— energy, a SOUL, a HEART</strong>. Company founders sense its presence. So do early employees and customers. It inspires people to contribute their talent, money, and enthusiasm and fosters a sense of deep connection and mutual purpose. If this spirit persists, engagement is high and start-ups remain agile and innovative, spurring growth. <br /><br />
      <strong>Technology</strong> has defined the key factor of growth rates for most companies for the past decades. Moore’s Law enabled unprecedented computing power, setting off a sprint in winner-take-all marketplaces with increasing returns to scale. Growth-hacking became the entrepreneurial mantra of the early 21st century, resulting in the creation of new tech giants, entirely new industries, and an era in which <strong>online</strong> community, content, and commerce(<strong>e-commerce</strong>) have redefined how we live, learn, and work.<br /><br />
      Looking at long-standing companies across various industries, we will be able to identify several <strong>foundational elements</strong> that have contributed to these companies’ tenures. They include society-first principles, adaptable long-term strategies, and scalable leadership.  <br /><br />
      Developing <strong>clarity</strong> about the <strong>core value</strong> they create for society, the <strong>adaptive capacity</strong> that will enable them to transition as markets evolve, and the system of leadership will increase the odds that they endure beyond their founding generation.<br /><br />
      In conclusion, making money is not the only motto here but even as companies institute processes, discipline, and professionalization, they should strive to retain the spiritual <strong>trinity of business intent, customer connection, and employee experience</strong>. It’s the secret to not only growth but also greatness.

    Title: "How engineers can be great entrepreneurs",
    Author: "Shrijita Som",
    Tags: "Careers",
    BannerURL: "https://source.unsplash.com/sMKUYIasyDM",
    Body: `
      MBA after B. Tech is a common trend nowadays and we can see a lot of engineers having their start-ups at some points of their lives. While the hype of taking up Engineering after 10+2 is much more than the rate of placements in that branch, having an Engineering degree as an entrepreneur can be really beneficial sometimes.<br /><br />
      Here’s a list of 6 reasons Engineers are naturally more likely to tackle their start-up hassles more proficiently.<br /><br />
      1) In this era, Technology is progressing at a rate like never before. In the era of IOT and clouds, most start-ups are likely to use some new-age technology to provide the best service. As an engineer, they have moderate to advanced knowledge in these domains and they can apply these in their start-ups more efficiently.<br /><br />
      2) Engineersae known for experiments. They are more used to applying new methods and having an experimental approach in anything and everything they lay their hands on. This mentality is best suited for an entrepreneur who always have to look for new opportunities and development of their start-ups.<br />
      There are so many occasions when an entrepreneur is stuck up in difficult and odd situations. They have to think up different ways to get out of these anyhow, books and former education will not come to much help here. And engineers are born “Jugaadu”s. They have enough experience of these scenarios in their college life, which is a great advantage of them here.<br /><br />
      3) From most of the general stream courses, Engineers have a greater exposure. They have all types of college fest in different colleges to attend to and their clubs also provide a community to learn more about entrepreneurship and meet new people and have experiences in this domain even before they graduate. <br /><br />
      4) An engineering curriculum consists of different subjects like Economics, Management, Environmental science which may not be directly related with their streams. These make them aware of different aspects of the industry beforehand.<br /><br />
      5) Most Engineering colleges organize grooming sessions. Apart from that, organizing and participating in so many college fests throughout the season also helps to build up essential people skills like leadership, teamwork, patience which is very much needed in start-ups.<br /><br />
      6) Despite all those tough schedules and last minute assignments, they get long semester breaks twice a year when they can learn special skills not included in their curriculum. Utilizing these extra free time wisely, they can gather precious experiences about start-ups in their course duration itself- which lessens the troubles in their start-ups later in their lives. <br /><br />
      People from any background and of any age group can be excellent entrepreneurs no doubt, but as an Engineer, you have certain advantages over others. If having a start-up is your dream and you are an engineer- great opportunities are waiting for you even in the midst of your course. Do not miss them at any cost!

      Regular 9- job sounds pretty boring, right? But it is as much alluring too, towards a safe and secured future. On the other hand, start-up has the spark in their name, with all the excitement, independence. But at the same time it is not it is very hard to pull off with no guarantee in your income.
      Before choosing any of these, you must think it through and analyze yourself. <br /><br />
      Here are some questions you must answer before choosing any of these- <br /><br />
      A)	Do you adore your freedom enough to sacrifice your stability? <br />
      You may have no one to order you every time but you will never know whether you will be bankrupted by the next week.<br /><br />
      B)	Are you a constant learner?<br />
      More specifically, a quick learner! No matter how prepared you are at the beginning, there will be always times when you have to learn and apply new things real quick to sustain your business. <br /><br />
      C)	Can you defy your job stability in order to pursue your dream?<br /><br />
      D)	Do you hold your monthly paycheck dearly?<br />
      Of course you do. I mean, are you strong willed enough to work day and night without the assurance of a secured paycheck?<br /><br />
      E)	How good are you in time management?<br />
      Can you allocate enough family time even when you are dealing with a tough situation in your start-up day in and day out?<br /><br />
      F)	How good are you in handling stress?<br />
      Be careful, as working on your start-up may have a serious toll on your health.<br /><br />
      G)	Are you comfortable to work beyond the regular working hours?<br />
      That too, without any assured overtime paycheck! There is a saying that job-workers work 9-5 but entrepreneurs do 5-9(5am to 9pm).<br /><br />
      H)	How good are you in communication, negotiating and network-building?<br />
      Soft skills are essential part of negotiation in order to deal with your workers, clients or investors.<br /><br />

      Take your time and introspect.
      If you have most of these answers as yes, you are ready to be an entrepreneur. Welcome to the world of thrill, innovation and freedom. Happy hustling.<br />
      But if you have only half the answers as yes, it is great time to look into the real world and think up what choice is best for you. Chances are, you are more suitable to execute other people’ dream rather than yours. You are the majority of the society and backbone of all the entrepreneurs.

      Planning startups is not easy. A start-up needs nourishment and careful thinking from its owner to flourish into a successful one. That said, it also involves taking essential risks. There are a lot of things to think about and a lot of decision making goes into it. To add to it, comes the pressure. The pressure of making decisions quite integral to the company. The pressure of knowing how adversely a bad decision could jeopardize the company’s growth. <br /><br />
      However, there is no plan that is 100% effective. But, there are certain mistakes people tend to make which have a negative impact on their businesses. <br /><br />
      <strong> 1. Skipping the Planning Phase Entirely </strong> <br /><br />
      Slow down. You have a business idea that needs a lot to before starting it out. Planning is and will be tedious. But without it, the business as well as you, will be in the dark. Business idea research and market potential are some topics that require planning on a large scale. Business plans, financial plans and market plans are key to a business. A business plan serves as a guiding light. It answers essential questions such as the purpose of the company, the targeted audience, the mission and values, the desired direction for the company, the company’s competitors, how the company differs from them and also how the success can be measured. <br /><br />
      <strong>2. Not setting SMART Goals</strong><br /><br />
      Goals are quite an essential part of any company. This is because it provides a direction and the result of its fulfilment. SMART means that your goal is Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-based. The goals can provide a specific path on how to approach it and attain the final result.<br /><br />
      <strong>3. Handling Money Incorrectly </strong><br /><br />
      Having sufficient funds for a start-up is quite as a boost. It is a very big deal and needs to be handled properly. A big mistake is spending too much. This can happen when a business owner or founder becomes quite eager and hires a large amount of people. Every owner has expectations towards its own companies. In initial stages, the owner may believe that it is necessary to hire all the employees. However, this results into burning finances quickly. To avoid this, staffing should only be done on a step-by-step basis. A founder can blow out his cash quite quickly by spending on unnecessary things. Instead of making good use of these funds, they are just wasted. Big investments by companies mean higher expectations. Thus, no spending funds on extra expenses. Only on essential things.<br /><br />
      <strong>4. Having a Pivot Plan in Place </strong><br /><br />
      Every entrepreneur says that almost nothing goes as planned. But being able to pivot is an essential part of planning. Earlier, Nokia was a paper mill and made rubber boots. Now, it is a telecommunications company. Twitter was once known as Odeo which was a podcast platform. When Apple launched its podcast platform, Odeo had to pivot. A backup plan should always be in place for very scenario and it requires flexibility.<br /><br />
      <strong>5. Undervaluing Products and Services You Offer </strong><br /><br />
      Lacking confidence in one’s abilities and failure fear to cause under-pricing of products or services. It is dangerous becomes the unique value of the product or service is undermined. It also opens the possibility of anxiety and frustration. Recovering from goods being undervalued is a difficult path. Thus, exploring the market is quite necessary before setting it up.<br /><br />
      <strong>6. Avoiding New Technology in Town </strong><br /><br />
      Technology provides a faster and efficient way to solve certain problems. It helps in efficient working and serving products efficiently. It can also help in saving money. New technology can be quite scary for people who don’t know how to use it. However, unwillingness to adapt to technology can hurt one’s business in both short and long term.<br /><br />
      <strong>7. Being Afraid of Marketing and taking up new Marketing Plans</strong><br /><br />
      Marketing belongs to a wide range. From referrals to traditional advertising to using social media as a booster. There are no rules to marketing. The best type of marketing depends on the business as well as the targeted audience. Assuming that one doesn’t need to go to the market is a huge mistake when it comes to the business being successful.<br /><br />
      <strong>8. Not Identifying the Ideal Customer</strong><br /><br />
      Understanding and recognizing the ideal customer to your business is quite essential. Creating a marketing budget and trying bits of everything, is not enough. Market research is quite essential. Identifying the person who you want to use your product, finding them and their reaction to your products as well as marketing activities is quite essential.<br /><br />
      <strong>9. Ignoring a hunch</strong><br /><br />
      An entrepreneur has his own instincts about his company. Ignoring it will certainly not be fruitful. Using it to an advantage is a key. The hunch if entertained, should be balanced with performance factors such as performance indicators and developing strategies through marketing research.<br /><br />
      <strong>10. Launching at the Wrong Time</strong><br /><br />
      Timing is everything. Certain circumstances lie completely out of control. These include the economy of a time and natural disasters. Launching of a business at a certain time cannot be arranged. There goes a long and extensivescientific research, which is quite necessary to ensure that the company doesn’t launch too early, or wait too long. Launching too soon can raise questions such as whether the products are actually needed by the people and whether it needs to be marketed. Waiting too long is also a problem. This is because there is a chance that the market may dry out or a competitor may come up first.<br /><br />
      We all make mistakes, but the key is to recognise them and work to make smart and correct decisions for one’s company. That said, do not give up. If you can do that, your business will surely grow.

      Automated technology is already a part of our daily lives. Now, what if we can blend in the idea of automation with green mobility ?? <br />
      To most of us, electric cars can seem so modern and exotic. In truth, electric cars are older than internal combustion vehicles. <br />
      Did you know that an electric car held the land speed record until 1900? Now, they are headed back to that dominance as some world’s largest auto manufacturers begin to create electric vehicles again and work to compete with each other. Companies like Tesla and even major automakers, like Toyota and General Motors, have begun selling electric vehicles that move fast, are fuel-efficient, and can travel longer distances. <br /><br />
      There is a large and growing movement to convert all vehicles to electric. They are more efficient and cleaner than gas or diesel vehicles. <br />
      One of the areas where there is a great promise is with freight trucks or lorries. A movement is afoot to convert these fuel-consuming vehicles to electric. The beauty is that an electric vehicle doesn’t release a lot of noxious smoke and fumes. This will make the air in our communities and along our highways cleaner and fresher. <br /><br />
      The future will be electric cars. Even the large oil and gas companies are assisting with energy storage technologies and battery development. <br />
      Electric cars are more efficient than their gasoline counterparts. As electric car charging stations are put up in front of every store, shopping center, and business, having an electric car will be more convenient than even gasoline or diesel vehicles. <br /><br />
      Our Mission is to bring transportation — for everyone, everywhere. <br /><br />
      Our Vision: Smarter transportation with fewer cars and greater access. Transportation that’s safer, cheaper, and more reliable; transportation that creates more job opportunities and higher incomes for drivers.
      Some myths-Not enough EV drivers, Charging EVs takes too long, Extreme weather will cause damage. 
      So one of the companies that fulfill the mission and vision and brings us one step closer to the future is Uber. Also one of the popular myth blasters is Aurora.  <br /><br />
      Why it works: Uber “transports,” so it is the perfect actionable verb for their mission. The vision dives deeper into how their transportation services exist for the greater good of everyone. <br /><br />
      With 360 degree cameras, lasers, and radars, these self-driving Ubers are well-equipped to see what’s on the road and beyond. vehicle operators are extensively trained to handle everything from a thunderstorm to a gaggle of geese crossing the road so you can ride comfortably knowing that our team is committed to keeping you safe. <br /><br />
      Michelangelo: Uber’s Machine learning Platform is well fitted for this job. <br /><br />
      At Uber, the contribution to this space is Michelangelo, an internal ML-as-a-service platform that democratizes machine learning and makes scaling AI to meet the needs of the business as easy as requesting a ride. Michelangelo enables internal teams to seamlessly build, deploy, and operate machine learning solutions at Uber’s scale. <br /><br />
      However now Uber has handed over the idea of autonomous cars to Aurora. <br /><br /> 
      “With the chance to start fresh, Aurora is applying machine learning to this problem, which means finding the right way to teach a computer what a good stop looks like. They call this “fueling the rocket.” The results are harder to see than all those new rungs, but once you’ve finished, you can go a lot higher, a lot faster.” 
      Building technology for impact: Building the world’s driver and its ecosystem to save lives, get crucial goods where they need to go and make mobility more efficient and accessible for all. <br /><br />
      With automakers around the world vying to maximize the value proposition of their respective electric vehicles (EVs), cars that don’t burn fossil fuels are becoming more and more mainstream. Also, Safety should be the top priority. It is top of mind in everything to be done, from the people to be hired, to the development and decision-making process. Safety is the foundation of a company’s culture.<br /><br />

      For most of us, ‘following our passion’ has a different name - ‘start-up’. 
      Being able to work on our own without anyone ruling over us is fascinating no doubt. And if doing what you love can be the source of your income, nothing can be better. <br /><br />
      But the dazzling scenarios about start-ups we visualize often have some larger than life elements, which is not true in the real case. It is important to know them before having your own start-up.<br /><br />
      •<strong>	Myth 1 </strong><br />
      Life is easier when no one is there to watch over you<br /><br /> 
      -<strong>	Reality </strong><br />
      No one maybe knocking you for deadlines, but your works are being watched over as a whole.<br />
      Most start-ups rely on investors to raise their funds, and they will support you as long as the growth of your start-up is satisfactory to them. Even your most trusted customer is noticing the quality of service you give them. <br />
      There will be no one sketching your deadlines and giving you instructions, but you must set deadlines for yourself and try to abide by them at all cost. There are no fixed work hours for entrepreneurs, they work 24/7- even when an average worker is celebrating a national holiday or sleeping in their bed.<br /><br />

      •<strong>	Myth 2 </strong><br />
      Entrepreneurs are born<br /><br />
      -<strong>	Reality </strong><br />
      In reality, entrepreneurs are made. By FAILURES. <br />
      Most of the successful start-up owners you see today have failed in their first few start-ups miserably, but they did not stop learning. You will face trouble in every step, and often it is hard to get over it, but do not forget the lesson these hurdles teach you. These problems have more to offer to you than any books or expert advice.<br /><br />
      •<strong>	Myth 3 </strong><br />
      You can relax easily when your start-up booms<br /><br />
      -<strong>	Reality </strong><br />
      Once you own a start-up, you can never be at ease. Never.<br />
      Some mishap can always occur, you service quality can decrease once you stop supervising effectively. Apart from that, a business always need to grow bigger and bigger. You always have to look for new customers and upgradation of your products and services. If your growth is completely stopped, your business will fall down in no time. So you have to continue to seek new opportunities to improve.<br /><br />
      •<strong>	Myth 4 </strong><br />
      Entrepreneurs are all super rich.<br /><br />
      -<strong>Reality </strong><br />
      Start-ups take time to establish properly. They need time to build their brand and customer base. You can find so many start-ups in their struggling period even after 4-5 years of service. Even if the entrepreneurs have earned sufficient money, they need to carefully invest it in their start-ups for safety and security in the future.<br /><br />
      •<strong>	Myth 5</strong><br />
      A proper plan is all you need to establish your start-up.<br /><br />
      -<strong>	Reality</strong><br />
      Plans are only for ideal situations, no matter how much risk measurement you have done. In real life, a plan may fetch you funds at most, but to succeed in business world, you need to have the tenacity, resilience and the mindset never to stop looking for solutions no matter what the situation is.<br /><br />
      •<strong>	Myth 6</strong><br />
      Hard work always pays off….at least for start-ups.<br /><br />
      -<strong>	Reality</strong><br />
      What you need is- smart work. You need to deal with the clients effectively, find solutions of your problems efficiently and figure out every probable possibilities quickly. Your hard work may fetch you nothing if you are not using all your resources wisely. So be aware of working tirelessly in some ineffective method.<br /><br />
      •<strong>	Myth 7</strong><br />
      Quality products or services will attract the customers itself<br /><br />
      -<strong>	Reality</strong><br />
      According to Robert Kiyosaki, there is a reason authors want to be known as “Best-selling” ones, not “Best writing” ones. No matter how good your plan is, if you do not invest enough in marketing, sales and customer support, you cannot progress much. The world famous fast food corners are not famous for providing the best taste, but for the proper advertising and marketing.<br /><br />
      •<strong>	Myth 8</strong><br />
      The market is easily predictable…. Or predictable at all.<br /><br />
      -<strong>	Reality</strong><br />
      These days, our surroundings are changing so quickly that even if you have the perfect plan made for current market condition, your customer needs may vary when you launch the product. It is very difficult to find out what people might actually want or like. So make sure to always have a plan B.<br /><br />
      •<strong>	Myth 9</strong><br />
      Branding is only maintaining your social media profiles.<br /><br />
      -<strong>	Reality</strong><br />
      Your brand is the colour you use in the cover of your products, the tone you use while dealing with the customers and the sincerity you have in solving the problems. Each and every aspects of your business builds up trusts among your customer base and secures your branding image. Focus on how you are being projected into the world.<br /><br />
      •<strong>	Myth 10</strong><br />
      You can rule over the employees once you own a start-up<br /><br />
      -<strong>	Reality</strong><br />
      Dealing with people and understanding their needs and problems are not always easy when you are working on a tight deadline. But neglecting your employers may decrease the overall efficiency of your start-up.
<br /><br />
      There is always risks whenever you want to do something off the beaten path, but that is what makes it more interesting to take up the ventures. Solving problems in real life scenarios and impacting the world with your start-up are fascinating enough to take up any challenges. <br /><br />
      Good luck for your future!

    Title: "Skills you need as an entrepreneur",

      For most of us, “Entrepreneur” is a dream-come-true occupation. They seem to be the magician by how delicately they can handle all the work-pressure, market condition and people. <br /><br />
      There are some skills that are common in every successful entrepreneurs out there. If you aspire to be one, it is high time to work on those skills so you can face less hazard in your start-up. <br /><br />
      1.	Ambition and persistence- <br /><br />
      I know, that was too obvious. Of course someone would have to be ambitious to start their own company all on their own. <br />
      But having just an ambition is not enough. Having an ambition subtly means you have an option to choose entrepreneurship. But you need to be one, and for that- you have to make it your identity. <br />
      Your dream may change from time to time but not your identity. You have no other way but to pursue working for your start-up no matter what the circumstances are. Only then you can establish yourself as an entrepreneur. <br />
      Having the identity also means the ability to dream big. Entrepreneurship is not a destination, it is a life-long journey. You must forge your way towards something bigger, no matter how much you have achieved till date. <br /><br />
      2.	Curiosity- <br /><br />
      You need to be “Jack of all trades” in your start-up, as implied by Robert Kiyosaki. <br />
      There will always be the fear of obsolescence, so you have to implement every new technological advancements in your start-up wherever possible. So the willingness to learn something new is an asset for you.<br />
      As the owner of your start-up, you have to manage every nook and corner of all the different wings and department of your start-up, or at least overview them well enough. For that, you have to have a vague idea at least of how all the parts of your business works. Only then you can understand if someone is cheating on you or something have to be changed.<br />
      Curiosity also inspires creativity- something that you need in every step of your start-up.<br /><br />
      3.	Communication-<br /><br />
      Yeah you need this skill in regular jobs too, it is essential to crack the interviews. But as an entrepreneur, you have to be the people on the other side of the table. You have to judge people and pick up the best of them for you. You have to manage all your employees and convey your ideas clearly so the workers can execute your planning properly. You have to truly listen and understand what others are saying and also build a strong network in the industry.<br /><br />
      4.	Courage-<br /><br />
      Courage is a crucial part for you. You have to assess a situation and face it with all you have.<br />
      The ability to take up risks at the right time at the right proportion is really needed in this domain.<br /><br />
      5.	Problem-solving-<br /><br />
      But most importantly, problem realizing. You have to find out the main reason of your problems and solve them accordingly.<br />
      Problem solving in your start-up is not as easy as it sounds. You need perseverance and resilience for it. Sometimes you may stuck in a problem for years, but you have to be patient and persistence enough to overcome it.<br /><br />
      6.	Management-<br /><br />
      By management, I mean money management, time and stress management and people management.<br />
      You have to be very calculative for what you invest in and how much you invest. Be it money or time. Even you have to know how much mentally involved you have to be in a problem so you do not exhaust yourself. People management is equally important to run your business well.<br />
      But never be too occupied by the calculations that you forget your creativity. Remember what Steve Jobs did during the launching of iPod- there was no market research. He did not have a readymade market, he created it.<br /><br />
      7.	Branding-<br /><br />
      Your first impression is your last impression. And that is your branding- your impression on the market. Work on it consistently and deliberately as your sales may vastly depend on your branding.<br /><br />

    The Airbnb foundation story is one of the most inspiring stories of the 21st century. From selling  cereals to being a 25 billion dollar company, the makers and the people behind the foundation of  
    this huge multinational chain have definitely come a long way through. It all started when Brian  Chesky and Joe Gebbia just moved from New York. Without employment, they were finding difficulty  
    in paying their rents and were desperately looking for measures to earn some extra money. They  noticed that all the hotel rooms in the city were booked, as the local Industrial Design Conference  
    attracted a lot of visitors. The youngsters used that opportunity and came up with a unique idea of  offering the visitors breakfast and a place to stay, at quite an affordable rate. They decided 
    to call  this start-up “Air Bed and Breakfast”. Nathan Blecharaczyk, a Harvard graduate joined the team as a technical architect and the third co-founder. They built a website that would cater to 
    the travelers’ needs. However, they had to face immense hardships initially because they received very few bookings. <br /><br />
    Like true entrepreneurs, instead of giving up hopes and succumbing to despair, they relaunched the  company in 2008. They began selling election-themed cereals in order to fund their startup and  
    decided to meet their customers in New York in order to communicate with them, share their ideas  and understand them better. After that incident, they shifted their focus from shared spaces to all  
    types of accommodation. The reason behind their success mainly attributes to their innovative ideas.  As we all know, people who love traveling often find it difficult to stay at hotels at various tourist  
    spots or other destinations because of the exorbitant rates. Airbnb attracts new visitors who stay  longer than traditional tourists, spend more on local businesses, and are more likely to be return  guests
     to the market as a result of their experience. This strengthens the tourism industry and creates additional opportunities for growth without requiring new investment or infrastructure on the part of the city. 
     Also, this venture of Airbnb has changed where guests stay when they travel. By staying in less concentrated neighborhoods, Airbnb guests distribute the economic impacts of travel to places that have not traditionally 
     received the benefits of the tourism industry. Airbnb has introduced this unique concept where people welcome their guests into their homes and host them throughout their stay, which in turn helps them make ends meet amid 
     this increasing living costs and income inequality.<br /><br />  
    The journey of Airbnb shows us determination, persistence, and hard work always yield success. This company fought against all odds to remain relevant. It has now over 2 billion properties listed on its websites across several 
    countries and hosts about 40 million guests. The company is one of the popular unicorn startups with an estimated worth of 25.5 billion. For a company that once sold  cereals, this is a praiseworthy achievement that has amazed, enticed, and inspired me at the same time. <br /><br />

    Body: `
      Most of the popular social media platforms today were not even invented just two decades ago! So many of us did not have access of the internet at the start of the previous decade (2010’s).<br /><br />  
      It is amazing to observe how the technology is advancing at lightning speed and changing the course of our lives. We are all eager to know which technical development will come next to upgrade our lives in this decade. Let us see which are the top 10 probable development we can safely assume to see by the end of this new decade -<br /><br />  

      • <strong />Artificial Intelligence(AI)</strong><br /><br />
      This one is pretty predictable, right? We can already see how the artificial intelligence is making robots like Sofia who can think and talk like humans, we also have AI bots as our Google assistant, Siri, Alexa and Cortana. We may see how these AI can lessen the need of human intelligence in many cases while we can focus on doing further essential researches.<br /><br />  
      • <strong />5G internet service</strong><br /><br />
      Though 5G services are not going to come in India in the next 5 years, we can expect it to be blooming by the end of 10 years. With the increased bandwidth and faster speed, it will give ease of access to the internet more and more so we can sync many of our everyday details with the internet to automate everything around us.<br /><br />  
      • <strong />Internet of Things(IOT)</strong><br /><br />  
      When we talk about automation, IOT is already booming there. But the more we are researching in this domain and inventing new gadgets and softwares, the more opportunities to develop our lives with IOT is opening in front of our eyes. From college students to professional, everyone is working hard to get the best out of this platform.<br /><br />  
      • <strong />Personalized medicine</strong><br /><br />  
      Everyone’s body composition vary from others. So is everyone’s medical history and current conditions. In this decade we can use AI, ML and IOT to store the patients’ past records, analyze the current health condition and prescribe the best medicine available for them.<br />
      These days it is not possible to find expert doctors whenever some emergency arises. Being able to find out the best choice of medicine will be a bliss for everyone out there. <br /><br />  
      • <strong />3D-print</strong><br /><br />  
      Medical Science is on its way of figuring out how to cultivate tissue artificially such that they can “print” a 3-D organ or other body parts that can be well-suited for a patient’s body. This will simplify the process of transplant and bring a revolution to the medial industry.<br /><br />  
      • <strong />	Block chain technology</strong><br /><br />  
      Most of us still believe the opportunities of this technology is limited to crypto currencies and Bitcoin, where is can be vastly used in cyber security too. Hopefully we can observe much more works on Block Chain in this domain.<br /><br />  
      • <strong />Sixth sense technology and VR</strong><br /><br />  
      So many researches have already taken place to develop sixth sense technology and much more is required. Till date we are vastly dependent on this rectangular device in our hands named as smartphones for anything and everything in our daily lives. After implementation of sixth sense technology and visual reality, we can leave our phones at home and use our senses and fingers to connect with the internet.<br /><br />  
      • <strong />Effective distribution of resources</strong><br /><br />  
      By finding out the exact amount of resources we have and our exact requirements, we can hopefully stop this irregular distribution of essentials like water and power. This will be a great help for the humanity to survive in the future.<br /><br />  
      • <strong />Solar power</strong><br /><br />  
      The petroleum and coals are decaying quickly and we have hardly any time to delay the implementation of other less popular resources. If we can properly utilize this power in this decade, the overall maintenance cost will reduce and we can have unlimited source of energy without destroying the world’s environment.<br /><br />  
      • <strong />Gene correction</strong><br /><br />  
      The advance researches on genetics are able to stop spreading of some genetic diseases like Thalassemia, but the process is rather expensive. After proper researches and commercialization, maybe we can see a world where theses genetic impurities can be sorted out easily and all of us can live our life to the fullest.<br /><br />  
      Which one of these are you waiting for?

      Visual reality is the new craze for our generation. Whoever ever watched a VR movie or played a VR game knows that.<br /><br />
      With every passing day, coders are discovering new ways to explore it and newer sectors to apply VR. Take a peek to know how you can expect this awesome technology to change your reality you have always seen!<br /><br />
      •	Medical-<br /><br />
      Remember the “boggart” concept? A creature that can turn into the object of your worst nightmare and you have to face it to know how to fight with the “dementors”. While JK Rowling actually took the idea of dementers from her depression, her thoughts can be implemented using VR. 
      You can face your worst fears and find a way to deal with it. It will be really grateful to fight with phobia, anxiety, PTSD, autism and other mental illness. It can be used to sooth a stressed mind too.<br />
      This VR can also work like a virtual 3-D printing.  Newbies can be trained digitally to have a clear idea of what actually happens at the OT whereas professionals can use it to visualize a complex operational procedure. VR is surely going to bring a revolution in the medical field.<br /><br />

      •	Movies and video games-<br /><br />
      OK, some of us have already an idea of how can it impact our movie watching or game playing experience, especially the once who have watched a 3-D movie. The horror movie becomes 3-4 times more horrific and the content will seem real.<br />
      Remember how many people died while playing the Pokémon-Go? VR makes anything way more engaging and addictive. While the market will make its full use to bag their profit, we need to be cautious for our own shake.<br /><br />

      •	Automobile-<br /><br />
      Yeah, we can be well-versed with real-life traffic within our training period. Apart from that, they can build 3-D image of the prototype. Who knows, maybe you can take a ride with a car not even built in reality! It will be a convenient and cheap option too.<br />
      Ford is already on their way to implement it.<br /><br />

      •	military and sports-<br /><br />
      The army can be trained really well and they can be well-versed with all types of equipment using visual reality. Their training will be a lot more effective.<br />
      Similarly, sport players can also be trained. Even the audience can enjoy the thrill of the gallery right from their home.<br /><br />

      •	Tourism-<br /><br />
      You can have a proper look of your destination before deciding where you go! Even the people with leg injuries or who are unable to go to a trip can have the feeling of going out.<br />
      You can easily have access to 360 degree view of your hotels too. <br />
      Even some museums are organizing a VR trip of that place.<br /><br />

      •	Education-<br /><br />
      And last but not the least use of VR- is our education and training.<br />
      Visualize a time when you can virtually go to another place while reading about it. You can witness the experiments right in front of you. Education will be so much fun, right?<br /><br />

    Body: `<div>Ever seen a donkey carrying a load ??</div>
    <div>Its owner lures it with a carrot and the donkey chases the illusion. The owner reaches his destiny, and it's another carrot for the donkey.</div>
    <div>The donkey here represents all who work for earning money, and its owner is someone who makes money.</div>
    <p>A mansion or a Cadillac is not the measure of how rich you are, it's the desire and passion to make money that makes you rich. It's how fast you can make a decision, it takes minutes on the internet, seconds for deals to come and go, and stock market trades are fixed within milliseconds. In these times of fast-moving fashion, hard work doesn't pay off, it’s all about smart work. Taking up a job or starting your own business whatever you choose, the roots of your financial education must be in-depth. It is not something we learn at our schools, it is what life teaches us. When it comes to matters regarding money the emotion which drives most of us is fear of risk. This fear of risking is most of the time greater than their passion. You do not have to be knowledgeable you just have to be bold to take the risk. What must you avoid for developing financial independence?</p>
    
    <h2><strong>Fear</strong></h2>
    <p>It is an emotion which most of us deny initially but for the same individuals, it is the greatest emotion that keeps on pushing them. No one doesn’t fear losing money. But it's not the fear, it's the way how you manage fear and overcome it. If you want to win big you must risk big and sometimes lose big, but the loss must come as an inspiration.</p>
    
    <h2><strong>Laziness</strong></h2>
    <p>Every time you say you can't afford something, it's you being lazy because there's nothing humans can't do. A little greed and ambition are sometimes good in your development and growth. Create your solutions to the financial problems and rise above the social dogma of guilt.</p>
    
    <h2><strong>Ignorance</strong></h2>
    <p>Ignorance is bad only when you let it sit and grow. If you try to educate yourself for your ignorance you learn something new. At every instance when arrogance hits, investors lose money. It's their mindset that something that they don't know is not worthy of knowing.</p>
    
    
    <h2><strong>Criticism</strong></h2>
    <p>Stop being a cynic, do not let your doubts and fears control you, analyze the criticism and make it work for your better.</p>
    
    <h3><i>Coming to the DOs for gaining financial stability-</i></h3>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Start investing early.</strong> Whether you take up a job or start your own business, you must start investing in assets. Something which is going to earn for you and pay for your luxuries.</li>
    
    <li><strong>How much money you keep.</strong> It is not the fact that you earn or are professionally excelling, it's how much you keep. One can earn lots of money and still suffer to make ends meet due to the lack of assets, which brings me to my next point.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Build your asset column.</strong> Very simply if I tell you asset is something that makes you money, and the handling of the assets and liabilities is what builds our social status. Feed the asset column and it's gonna feed your generations to come.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Learn something new.</strong> Now and then we hear people say to do what you enjoy, what your heart desires, but how many of us do that!? It's all about caring for what interests us and only then are we going to invest and enjoy doing it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In the end, it's you who is going to have to rise above your doubts and fears to attain your financial strength. The cultural dogma that runs deep in our society and which makes us believe that love for money is the root of all evil. We must break apart from all that holds us back and start investing smartly.</p>

    Body: `<div>Whether you’re a content creator looking for an online course platform to sell courses, or a student looking to learn from online courses, searching for the best online course platforms in recent times is indeed a hectic task. Education has changed dramatically, with the distinctive rise of e-learning, whereby teaching is undertaken remotely and on digital platforms.</div>
    <div>But why is E-learning on the hype now ?? For that, let’s first know what exactly is an eLearning platform in technical terms!</div>
    <p>An online learning platform is an integrated set of interactive online services that provide trainers, learners, and others involved in education with information, tools, and resources to support and enhance educational delivery and management. One type of eLearning platform is a learning management system (LMS). The purpose of a successful eLearning platform is that it creates a robust learning experience that feels like a classroom experience, offering the traditional classroom characteristics (like instructor-student interaction, Q&As, discussion, games, collaborative projects, quizzes, etc.) but either online or through a device (e.g. a laptop, desktop, tablet or mobile.) These important learning environments are achieved through a learning platform’s features and tools that create the level of interaction and engagement students need.</p>
    <p>There are many eLearning companies out there that offer learning platforms. Some of these platforms allow you to host and sell online courses, allowing you to run your own business. Other platforms simply offer an interface in which users can interact with your content, but might not be the best fit for your audience.</p>
    <div>Now how to choose an eLearning platform? Or how do you decide which platform is the best to host your training courses?</div>
    <div>For that, knowing what makes good e-learning and course builder platforms should be one’s topmost priority.</div>
    <ol>
    <li>E-learning platform- An Efficient Learning Management System is necessary for every learner to boost their performance level and knowledge-retention levels. LMS options can be assessed based upon –
    <ul>
    <li>What are your learner’s needs?
    <br/>
    Learners are the central, focal point of a training program.
    Depending on industry and business objectives, one will want an LMS that offers features that address the learners’ needs.</li>
    <li>Is your LMS Mobile-Friendly?
    <br/>
    No matter the industry, learners prefer to have accessibility to training content on-the-go, so that they can have complete flexibility in their self-learning cycle. One wants to make sure that the LMS that he/she chooses is compatible with mobile phones.</li>
    <li>Does your LMS offer integrations with features and systems?<br/>
    An LMS feature that simplifies the user experience is the Single-sign-on (SSO).  This feature allows the user to access other applications with the same credentials, without repeatedly logging in credentials on different apps within the same LMS. This is required.</li>
    <li>Is your LMS reliable and secure?<br/>
    One of the more important details to pay attention to when choosing an LMS is how it handles sensitive information. A security breach could cost an organization its reputation and brand image. Ensuring that the LMS has the right security protocols, firewalls and SSL is vital in protecting your content and user’s personal data.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Course builder platform – A Course Builder can help you create and deliver online lessons for universities, professional training, or corporate products.  Following are a few things that may affect your ability to build better courses and grow your business over time.
    <ul>
    <li>Course building features<br/>
    Different learning management systems (LMS) offer different course creation features. For instance, one may want to give assignments to students, create quizzes, or offer multiple payment methods.</li>
    <li>Payment solutions<br/>
    You may also want to make sure that they offer payment solutions that are affordable for you as a business owner.</li>
    <li>Integrations</br>
    Integrations help you connect your online courses to third-party platforms and marketing automation tools. For instance, you may want to connect it with your email marketing service, social media marketing tool, or your CRM software.</li>
    <li>Flexibility and Freedom<br/>
    Many online course platforms may have terms and conditions that may affect your business. Some platforms compromise on flexibility for ease of use, which means you have less control over your courses, and you cannot add new customization/features to your course.</li>
    <li>Ease of use and support<br/>
    As a course creator and entrepreneur, you want to choose a course builder that is easy for you to use. It should come with customizable templates, work with your website, and offer good customer support. You also want to make sure that it is user-friendly for your students and customers too.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Some top eLearning platforms include WizIQ, iSpring, Academy of Mine, Udemy, Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, Skillshare, etc.. and some top course marketplace in recent times include LearnDash, Teachable, Thinkific LifterLMS, WooCommerce,  Kajabi, Podia, LearnWorlds, etc. All platforms have some pros and some cons. Whatever profession you are in, whether you’re a student looking for the best online learning platform to expand your skills or you are searching for an online platform to build and sell courses and grow your business without spending a fortune, the aforementioned points that have been discussed should always play a distinctive role in the selection. The discussion has been made to help avoid choice paralysis and thereby save the price of time.</p>
    
    <p>With the new technologies available to us today, the term E-Learning has come to be all-inclusive of any instruction delivered using technology. Today E-Learning encompasses many technologies used for training and instruction. Simulations, gaming, mobile devices, GPS technologies, and many more can be used for the development of E-Learning experiences. They can also be blended, creating a multimedia learning experience.</p>

    Title: "HUMANS RELATION WITH TECHNOLOGY ",
    BannerURL: "https://source.unsplash.com/SYTO3xs06fU",
    Author: "Abhinav Singh",
    Tags: "Future Technology",
    Body: `<div>What is a human being? What is their culture? What is their identity? How they are connected to modern technology? How do they differ from animals? These are the few questions that need a deep investigation and conceptualized understanding of human culture about technology. It has to be analyzed, keeping in mind the other framework such as classical ontology, economy, phenomenology, existentialism.</div>
 
    <p>Great analysts of the twentieth century said that technology plays an important role in shaping human behavior from time to time. It’s like a track which gets updated every time and human switch from one technology to other with time as per the advancement. In our modern civilization, technology microscope and MRI scan have become an effective tool in analyzing and diagnosis. So, technology has also born on our view of things.</p>
     
    <div>This blog focuses on how with the changing time technology influences and constitutes human culture and existence. In this context, we will also discuss how the boundary between traditional design and use has faded by the involvement of technology in human civilization. The rapid development of the mind and body of humans with the development of technology has influenced self-consciousness, autonomy, and racialism which is also an important part of the interaction of man and technology.</div>
    <h3><strong>OVERVIEW:</strong/></h3> 
    <p>In the last few decades, technology has progressed at a staggering rate. Smartphones, the internet, cloud computing, and hundreds of other inventions are changing every facet of our lives. 
    Communication, business, government, travel, fundraising, and even agriculture have been affected. But how about our brains? Is all this new technology changing us on the inside? Many think so, including psychology professionals.</p>
     
    <div>As Psychology Today says, “There is … little doubt that all of the new technologies, led by the Internet and digital technology, are shaping the way we think in ways obvious and subtle, deliberate and unintentional, and advantageous and detrimental.”* While research into this field is still in its infancy and there are no scientifically agreed-upon conclusions, there are several areas where modern digital technology is certainly affecting the way we interact with the world and the way our children’s brains develop. These areas include:</div>
     <ul>
    <li>Attention<br/> 
    Evidence suggests that the constant use of technology is shortening our attention span. Nowadays people use most of their time in these electronic gadgets like smartphones etc. Spending time playing games, listening to music, browsing, chatting has made our mind narrow and the capacity of focusing on any particular task gets hampered. Students can’t concentrate on their studies, job seekers can’t refine their skills as per the requirement. Their persistence capacity is reducing day by day. They get distracted very soon with any notification on their smartphones.</li> 
     
    <li>Decision Making<br/>
    The capacity of a man to think and take action is the most important feature that differentiates a human being from an animal. But, this characteristic of a man is fading with time. Instead of analyzing, thinking about the consequences, people tend to feel much comfortable in solving their queries online. Earlier, people use to take advice from their elders who already had gained knowledge by their experience but today that ‘network building’ capacity is reducing rapidly. Remember that a place of a doctor can never be overtaken by a machine. The doctor analyses and interprets the patient’s condition and by his knowledge and experience treats them accordingly. Overall, it is clear that one must not depend too much on technology for decision-making and analysis as humans are the creator of technology, not machines.</li> 
     
    <li>Distraction<br/>
    Concentration is always the opposite of distraction. Although technology has its boon, excessive use and its addiction can become one of the causes of distraction. 
     
    Particularly, students who have made phones their best friends. It became the main cause behind most of their devastation. They waste their time using the internet. Once their phones give a tweet tweet notification tone they forget all their work and give a dive in the ocean of distraction. As a student, they have a duty towards themselves. They must use the internet to the fullest to gain knowledge and wisdom and not for their failure. Serving unwanted sites, vulgar content can ruin the mental capacity and strength.</li> 
     
    <li>Relationship Building<br/>
    There was a time when people use to spend their time sharing their thoughts, their life happening with their fellow men. Family played an important role for them. But, today we humans keep ourselves busy with technology. We rarely have time to spend with our family. Even if we are doing, we keep ourselves indulge in the internet. We often miss the present and memorable moments of our life with our friends and family by keeping ourselves busy in the online world. Never involve yourself too much in technology as it can ruin your relationship very badly.</li> 
     
    <h3><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h3> 
    <p>Understanding the concept and need of technology will broaden our minds and bring us closer to the world. It will enlighten our basic knowledge be it in any field ‘health’, ‘career’, ‘job’, ’development’, ‘education’ etc. Just as a coin has two different phases, in the same way everything and anything has its boon as well as a curse. It depends on the person how and for what purpose he or she is using it. Keeping in mind the above statement; Technology can also build the world or destroy the world.</p>
